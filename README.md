# Cardio-Vascular Risk Detection

## Description
I explored various **Unsupervised learning algorithms** on Cardiovascular Risk Detection Data. I sought to contribute to the early identification and mitigation of cardiovascular risks, a paramount concern for global public health. Through this endeavor, I aimed to pave the way for more effective preventive strategies and informed medical interventions, ultimately leading to a reduction in cardiovascular-related morbidities and enhancing the overall quality of patient care


## Variables Description

### Demographic:

**Sex:** male or female ("M" or "F")
**Age:** Age of the patient (Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)
Education: The level of education of the patient (categorical values - 1,2,3,4)


### Behavioral:

1. **is_smoking:** whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO")
Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)
Medical (history):
2. **BP Meds:** whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)
Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)
3. **Prevalent Hyp:** whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)
Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal)
Medical (current):
4. **Tot Chol:** total cholesterol level (Continuous)
5. **Sys BP:** systolic blood pressure (Continuous)
6. **Dia BP:** diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)
7. **BMI:** Body Mass Index (Continuous)
8. **Heart Rate:** heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)
9. **Glucose:** glucose level (Continuous)
Predict variable (desired target):
10. **10-year risk of coronary heart disease CHD(binary: “1”, means “Yes”, “0” means “No”)**

## Data sources
I have sourced the dataset from Kaggle. Please find more information [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mamta1999/cardiovascular-risk-data)
*Please add your `kaggle.json` to the root directory to access the data*
The dataset provided information on over **4,000 patients and included 15 attributes**, each representing a potential risk factor for CHD. These attributes included demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Post loading the dataset, I conducted basic **Exploratory data analysis**. I started with visualizing various patterns in the data, using **HistPlot and PairPlot** features in Seaborn.

</p>

2. **Label Econding** was performed on string feature of "sex" and "is_smoking". **Absolute value correlation** between every feature was analysed and plotted to as the following:

</p>

3. **Skew transformation** was conducted on skewed data, using *log, square root and boxcox* transformations.

</p>


4. On handling **outliers**, the data was scaled using **StandardScalar** to better fit the classification model. The difference is shown here:

</p>

5. A **multicollinearity graph** gives more insight into the relation between each feature.

## Machine Learning Models and Accuracy
1. I applied **K-Means Clustering algorithm** on the data, restricting no. of clusters to 2, and the results were as follows:

        <img src="Pics\sysBP_age_Clustering.png" height="300px" width= "250px"/> &emsp; <img src="Pics\age_diaBP_Clustering.png" height="300px" width= "250px"/> &emsp; <img src="Pics\diaBP_heartRate_cluster.png" height="300px" width= "250px"/> 
</p>

2. Further, I applied **soft clustering** algorithms(returns probabilities of each data point belonging to all k clusters) like **GMM(Gaussian Mixture Model)**. Using a **Decision Tree Classifier** gave the accuracy score 0.78

</p>

3. **DBSCAN(density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm)** clustered data into 5 groups with 318 points of noise, performing poorly with the data. Similarly, **mean-shift clustering** failed to group the data.

4. In order to reduce dimensions and work more efficiently with the data, **PCA(Principal Component Analysis)** was used. The plot shows the accumulated explained variance ratio for the fitted PCA object.

</p>

5. PCA analysis showed that we can keep the **first 12 components** and discard the other 6, keeping **>=99.0% of the explained variance**. Variance explained by dimensions(left) and Feature importance Vs Dimensions(right) is shown below. This improved the accuracy score when applied to above algorithms to 0.84.

## Conclusion
I conducted an in-depth exploration of diverse **Unsupervised learning algorithms utilizing Cardio-vascuar Risk data**, revealing compelling patterns. These findings have the potential to offer valuable insights into heart health, thereby informing medical institutions and guiding preventive measures.
